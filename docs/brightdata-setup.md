- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

#### "Invalid Bright Data API token"
- Double-check your API token in the Bright Data dashboard
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the token

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Check your Bright Data plan limits
- Consider upgrading your plan or waiting before retrying

#### "Timeout waiting for LinkedIn profile data"
- Some profiles may take longer to fetch
- Try again with a different profile
- Check Bright Data status page for any service issues

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling
The integration includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid URLs are rejected before API calls
- Clear error messages for setup issues
- Graceful fallback to manual entry

### 2. User Experience
- Show loading state during import
- Provide clear feedback on success/failure
- Offer manual entry as an alternative

### 3. Data Privacy
- Only import user's own profile data
- Don't store API credentials in code
- Clear cache periodically for privacy

## Alternative Import Methods

If Bright Data is not suitable, users can still:
1. **Copy & Paste**: Manual copy from LinkedIn
2. **PDF Upload**: Save LinkedIn profile as PDF (future feature)
3. **Manual Entry**: Type information directly
